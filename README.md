## Challenges

- [X] Handling asynchronous data fetching from Supabase and syncing it with React Router (especially for detail pages and edit routes) was a challenge.
- [X] Managing form state across different components (like pre-filling the Edit form and handling input changes without breaking the post object) required careful structure by using objecy spreading.
- [X] Implementing the search bar and the filter buttons were also difficult. It required making sure the displayed posts updated dynamically without re-fetching from Supabase every time.
